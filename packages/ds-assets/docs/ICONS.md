# Canonical DS Icons

This document explains our thinking and the current state of our icon set.

## Icon requirements
In order to establish a baseline level of consistency across our icon set, we have defined a set of requirements
for all core icons.

Each icon shall:

1. Be stored as a single SVG file this directory
2. Be named using the format `<name>.svg`
3. Contain a single `<g>` element with the id `<name>`.
4. Use the same 16x16 viewbox size
5. All paths shall be filled with `currentColor` - with an exception for branded icons.

Icons adapt their color and size to their context. We use a consistent 16x16 viewbox across all icons, ensuring that when you need to adjust size, the scaling remains predictable regardless of the icon you're using.

Each icon's contents are wrapped in a `<g>` element with a matching ID (e.g., `<g id="warning">` for warning.svg). This pattern enables efficient reuse through SVG's `<use>` element - you can reference these icons in your markup like `<use href="path/to/warning.svg#warning" />`. Since the behavior of each icon is defined by these standards rather than implementation-specific code, platform libraries can stay lightweight. They just need to handle the mechanics of loading and displaying SVGs, keeping their APIs flat and predictable regardless of which icon you're using.

## Coloring

Icons adapt their color to their context by consuming `currentColor`. This means that the icon will inherit the
text color of its parent element.

### Changes since Vanilla

Historically, our icons have not followed a consistent coloring approach. Some icons have been monochromatic, consuming
`currentColor`, while others have been multichromatic, using multiple colors defined in our color palette.

To improve consistency and simplify implementation, we have updated all icons to be monochromatic,
consuming `currentColor`.

Icons that have been updated to follow this approach are listed below.

#### Branded icons

Branded icons (e.g., social media logos), formerly used hard-coded brand colors. These icons have been updated to consume `currentColor` instead.
Additionally, some of these icons had `-dark` variants to be used on light backgrounds. These variants have been removed, as the icon now adapts its color to its context, removing the need for explicit theming.

#### Status icons

Status icons frequently use color to convey meaning (e.g.,  red for error, green for success, yellow for warning).
In the interest of simplicity and uniformity (all non-branded icons should consume `currentColor`), these icons
have been updated to consume only `currentColor`.

Status icons that have been updated:
- `conflict`
- `conflict-resolution`
- `email`
- `error`
- `status-in-progress`
- `status-waiting`
- `success`
- `unit-running`
- `warning`

#### Multichromatic non-branded icons
Some non-branded icons have also been multichromatic in the past.
These are, so far, icons with a rounded, filled background shape, and multiple colored paths drawn on top.

These icons have been simplified to also be monochromatic, consuming `currentColor` for all paths.

Multichromatic non-branded icons that have been updated:
- `email` - Previously had a grey background circle with envelope path
- `status-in-progress` - Previously had a blue background circle with loading spinner slices

## TypeScript Support

### Constants & Types

The [`src/icons` folder](../src/icons) contains the full list of icons as a TypeScript array (`ICON_NAMES`) and as a
type (`IconName`).

#### Usage example

```ts
import type {IconName} from "@canonical/ds-assets";

export interface MyComponentProps {
  iconName: IconName;
}
```

## SVG Optimization

TBD, in a follow-up we may update the icon standardization script to optimize SVGs using SVGO or a similar tool.
