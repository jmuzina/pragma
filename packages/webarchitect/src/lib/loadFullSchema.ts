/**
 * Loads a schema and recursively resolves all extended schemas.
 * Merges rules from parent schemas with child schemas, where child

 * @param schemaArg - Schema identifier (built-in name, file path, or URL)
 * @returns Promise that resolves to the fully merged schema with all extensions resolved
 * @throws Will throw an error if any schema in the inheritance chain cannot be loaded
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Load a schema that extends other schemas
 * const schema = await loadFullSchema("package-react");
 * // Returns merged schema with rules from base, base-package, and package-react
